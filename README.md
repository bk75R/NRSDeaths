# NRSDeaths
Calculating and reformatting NRS weekly deaths data for all available age categories

The code shared here was used to calculate the link between excess deaths and percentages of the Scottish population who received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
I wrote a series of blog posts on this topic here:

I'm making this code and data available here because the National Records of Scotland doesn't make deaths data available in a more usable format for presenting and analysing deaths in Scotland.
